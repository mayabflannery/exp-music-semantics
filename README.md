## Hypothesis

Variables: Stimulus (4 * 14); Word lists: (14 X 38 X ??)

H_0: When a participant hears a stimulus, they select a random number of random words from each list.
H_1: When a participant hears a stimulus, they select few random words from each list.
H_1: When a participant hears a stimulus, they select few related words from each list.

We can hypothesize the number of genres selected (1 is most likely, 2, 3+ less common)
- use proportion? 10% of available words?
