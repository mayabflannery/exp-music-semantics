## Funding Source

## Purpose of Study

Music is an important art form in society that impacts many aspects of the human experience. Due to the variability of musical elements, genres, and features within music, there is also variability in how music is perceived within individuals. While using the classification of. to describe music can be valuable, it remains ill-defined and has led to confusing and inconsistent interpretations in research.

You are invited to take part in this study to improve our knowledge of how lower-level features of music are interpreted and perceived in singular musical pieces.

## Procedures involved in the Research

This study involves listening to music with headphones and selecting answers on a computer. There will be two sections. The first section will gather basic demographic information about you. The second section involves listening to short musical excerpts. You will be asked to rate how each musical excerpt sounds based on 6 different criteria.

You may choose to take a break at any point during the study. This experiment should take roughly 50 minutes and will take place online (the web service, Pavlovia).

## Potential Harms, Risks, or Discomfort

There are no known risks to this study. The decibel level of the sounds used will be within the range of everyday speech. You are free to adjust your headphones/speaker to a comfortable level of loudness (or softness). You do not need to answer any questions you do not wish to or that make you feel uncomfortable; you may withdraw from the experiment at any time.

## Reimbursement

You will receive one research participation credit for participating in this experiment.

## Potential Benefits

This research will not benefit you directly. We hope that what is learned in this experiment will help us better understand how individuals experience and enjoy music.

## Confidentiality

All information gathered in this study is anonymous and will not be linked to named individuals. No personal information will be revealed at any time. Your participation will be assigned an anonymous ID number. Information connected to that number will be kept in a locked filing cabinet and/or a password protected file on the computer in the locked laboratory. Within two years, the original raw data will be deleted. We would like to practice and promote open science research. A part of open science practice involves making a particular study's data available to other researchers who may find it valuable to their own research, or to verify the integrity of our results. Thus, selected anonymous data from this study may be provided in an online repository that is accessible to other researchers. If you would like to know more about this initiative, please contact Maya Flannery.

## Participation and Withdrawal

Your participation in this experiment is voluntary and you may choose to withdraw at any time, even after the consent form is signed. If you decide to withdraw, there will be no consequences to you and any data you have provided will be removed unless you indicate otherwise. If you do not want to answer some of the background questions, you may leave them blank and continue with the study.

## Questions about the Study

If you have any questions or would like more information about the study, please contact Maya Flannery (flannerm@mcmaster.ca) or Dr. Woolhouse (woolhouse@mcmaster.ca).

This study has been cleared by the McMaster University Research Ethics Board. If you have concerns or questions about your rights as a participant or about the way the study is conducted, please contact:
