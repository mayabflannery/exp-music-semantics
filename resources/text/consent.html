    <h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Music is an important art form
        in society that impacts many aspects of the human experience.
        Due to the variability of musical elements, genres, and
        features within music, there is also variability in how music
        is perceived within individuals. While using the classification
        of “genre” to describe music can be valuable, it remains
        ill-defined and has led to confusing and inconsistent
        interpretations in research.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You are invited to take part in
        this study to improve our knowledge of how lower-level features
        of music are interpreted and perceived in singular musical
        pieces.</p>
    <h2>Procedures involved in the Research</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This study involves listening
        to music with headphones and selecting answers on a computer.
        There will be two sections. The first section will gather
        basic demographic information about you. The second section involves
        listening to short musical excerpts. You will be asked to rate
        how each musical excerpt sounds based on 6 different
        criteria.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may choose to take a break at any
        point during the study. This experiment should take roughly 50 minutes
        and will take place online (the web service, Pavlovia).</p>
    <h2>Potential Harms, Risks, or Discomfort</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are no known risks to
        this study. The decibel level of the sounds used will be within
        the range of everyday speech. You are free to adjust your
        headphones/speaker to a comfortable level of loudness (or
        softness). You do not need to answer any questions you do not
        wish to or that make you feel uncomfortable; you may withdraw
        from the experiment at any time.</p>
    <h2>Reimbursement</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will receive one research
        participation credit for participating in this experiment.</p>
    <h2>Potential Benefits</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This research will not benefit
        you directly. We hope that what is learned in this experiment
        will help us better understand how individuals experience and
        enjoy music.</p>
    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">All information gathered in
        this study is anonymous and will not be linked to named
        individuals. No personal information will be revealed at any
        time. Your participation will be assigned an anonymous ID
        number. Information connected to that number will be kept in a
        locked filing cabinet and/or a password protected file on the
        computer in the locked laboratory. Within two years, the
        original raw data will be deleted. We would like to practice
        and promote open science research. A part of open science
        practice involves making a particular study's data available to
        other researchers who may find it valuable to their own
        research, or to verify the integrity of our results. Thus,
        selected anonymous data from this study may be provided in an
        online repository that is accessible to other researchers. If
        you would like to know more about this initiative, please
        contact <a href="mailto:%20flannerm@mcmaster.ca">Maya
            Flannery</a>.</p>
    <h2>Participation and Withdrawal</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your participation in this
        experiment is voluntary and you may choose to withdraw at any
        time, even after the consent form is signed. If you decide to
        withdraw, there will be no consequences to you and any data you
        have provided will be removed unless you indicate otherwise. If
        you do not want to answer some of the background questions, you
        may leave them blank and continue with the study.</p>
    <h2>Questions about the Study</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any questions or
        would like more information about the study, please contact
        Maya Flannery (flannerm@mcmaster.ca) or Dr. Woolhouse
        (woolhouse@mcmaster.ca).</p>
