    <h2>Background</h2><!-- p is a paragraph -->
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Humans have produced and listen
    to a wide range of musical styles. Listening behaviour between
    individuals suggests that people describe and interpret similar
    types of music in different ways. Genre is a classification
    method that is useful to categorize musical pieces that belong
    to a shared group (e.g., rock songs all sound a certain way).
    There are shortcomings, though, in that genres are difficult to
    describe and interpret in scientific studies (e.g., what
    exactly does rock music sound like?). Music acoustic features
    are proposed to be measurable, manipulable, and perceivable
    within music. They can help objectively describe and categorize
    music.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The study you just participated
    in aims to help identify and establish these foundational music
    acoustic features. They should be objectively measurable,
    manipulable and musically/psychologically relevant to
    participants. By providing evidence for these
    feature-characteristics, we aim to provide more accurate
    descriptions of music. With this increased objectivity, we seek
    to better understand previous findings in music cognition
    research and improve the methods we use in upcoming studies. By
    investigating individual interpretations of music, we hope to
    better understand how individuals relate to music.</p>
    <h2>The experiment</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This study began by asking
    basic demographic questions about you. This measure is used to
    get an idea of how musical training and other personal factors
    affect the genres you perceive. The second part
    of the study presented musical excerpts (independent variable)
    that varied in musical style and certain musical features. You
    then rated (dependent variable) how much an excerpt sounded (on
    a Likert-scale) like each of six robust music acoustic
    features. We will compare your responses to (1) how other
    individuals rated the musical excepts and to (2) audio waveform
    analyses to determine whether the features we have selected are
    appropriate for future studies in music cognition.</p>
